## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:15%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you’ll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you’ll get full credit. The projects are time consuming, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly. Note that, each student will be evaluated separately according to personal commit number.

**Report Quality:15%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

**Technical Level:70%:** The detail level of your simulations and your conclusions.

## Number of Commits:

In this project the minimum expected number of commits on different days is 2. Each days you made at least one commit is 5 points (saturating at 10 points). 

You'll get 5 points from the content of your commit messages. You are supposed to write clear and explanatory commit messages, listing what  specific improvements that you made in that version. Please have a look at the following links:
