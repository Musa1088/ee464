## Guideline for Project #2

Here are the important points for Project #2

- You will complete the project with your hardware project team.
- You can create a repo in one of the team member's account, and add me as acollaborator, so I can access your files.
- You can use any software tool you want.
- At the end of the project, you are required to submit a project report (in PDF) as well as your simulation files.
- Reports will be checked using Turnitin, and copying will not be tolerated.
- No reports and commits will be accepted after the deadline.

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:15%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list (at least 3 commits per team member). For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you’ll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you’ll get full credit. The projects are time consuming, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly. Note that, each student will be evaluated separately according to personal commit number.

**Report Quality:15%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

**Technical Level:70%:** The detail level of your simulations and your conclusions.


## Report Quality:

You report quality will be evaluated using the following criteria:

- The report has a separate title page (2pts)
- The report has an introduction section that briefly explains the content and the aims of the report (2pts)
- The report organized properly with clear sections and subsections (2pts)
- All figures and tables have proper captions (3pts)
- The graphs have proper axes labels and font size of labels is adequate (3pts)
- No grammar/spelling errors and very well-written report (hint: use spell-check) (3pts)

## Technical Level:

Following grades will be applied for the technical parts:

- Q1: 
    - a) 5pts
    - b) 15pts
